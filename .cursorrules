# Important Paths
- trading_data.db path = "C:\Users\StdUser\Desktop\MyProjects\Backtesting\MT5\StrategyTester\streamlit\logs\trading_data.db"
- mlflow.db path = "C:\Users\StdUser\Desktop\MyProjects\Backtesting\MT5\StrategyTester\streamlit\mlflow.db"

#  Frequent mistakes you do and you should keep in mind to avoid these.
1. I am using PowerShell in Windows machine. You have to wait for some time after executing the Powershell commands to view the terminal output. You are frequently moving on without waiting for the output.
2. When I ask you to replicate the code/layout, you should replicate the code but use different identifiers so that there is no conflict with the existing code.
3. Make sure to use the different unique identifiers for the components in the UI.
4. Since I am using Powershell, using '&&' is not working. So, use ';' to run multiple commands in the same line.


# Prefered Code Structure:
1. Core component (file to have all core logic)
2. CLI interface (to handle core component via argparse)
3. Streamlit UI interface ( page to handle core component similar to cli, but in a more user friendly)





# Instructions/Rules to follow
1. You need to execute the scripts ONLY from this path "C:\Users\StdUser\Desktop\MyProjects\Backtesting\MT5\StrategyTester\streamlit"
2. Before making changes, go through the entire file and understand if there are any other changes have to be done for the same issue as this will reduce multiple iterations. 
3. If you are stuck on an issue, try to include more logging to understand where and why the error is coming. Only after understanding the issue, try to fix it.
4. If you have gone through multiple iterations and still stuck on the same issue.
    - you should think OUT OF THE BOX and try to solve the issue. 
    - Revisit the old issues we faced and DON'T repeat it again.
    - Go through the entire code and revisit the plan and with the context, try to tackle it.
5. If you need clarification, ask the user. DON'T ASSUME!
6. Always try to reuse the existing code. Create only if that is not possible.
7. I am running MLflow like this 
mlflow ui --backend-store-uri "sqlite:///mlflow.db"

# Important
1. If you need to query sqlite database, query via a simple python script rather than command line.
2. I can provide you any access you want. For ex: if you want to query a database for schema or a sample data from a DB, ask me and you can use a simple python script to have the actual data without any assumptions.
3. Always work on the basis of what is observed in the logs and actual data. 

# General Guidelines
- Write clean, readable, and well-structured code.
- Reliability is the top priority- If you can't be sure that the code will work, don't build it.
- Implement features in the simplest way possible.
- Think thoroughly about the code before writing it.
- Plan the next steps in detail


# Error fixing
- Consider multiple possible causes before deciding on the solution. Do not jump to conclusions.
- Explain the problem and the solution in a way that is easy to understand.
- Always verify the fix.
- Consider the context of the code.
