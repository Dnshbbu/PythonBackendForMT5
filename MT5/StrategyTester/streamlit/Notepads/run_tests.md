1. I want you to go to the location "C:\Users\StdUser\Desktop\MyProjects\Backtesting\MT5\StrategyTester\streamlit\" in terminal and execute the below

2.run "python -m pytest tests\ -v --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing --durations=0 -W always"

    if there are any failures(any other errors ), inform me.

    with my permission, try to fix them.

    if no errors, move to next step.
