# Replicate to some other page based on a page

## Replicate table selection

can you look at my train_pycaret_models_pagev2.py and implement the same table selection in deep_learning_page.py?

Make sure it has its own different identifiers etc., I dont want to have any conflicts between as we are replicating the same style and format.

## Replicate output section

Please implement the similar output section (right side) including the Stop training button from train_pycaret_models_pagev2.py to my deep_learning_page.py

Please go through the reference code and implement it carefully. I previously faced issues regarding the visualization of charts.

Also, make sure the components are identified uniquely as we are replicating similar styles. I dont want conflicts between the components.

## Replicate Equivalent command section

The 'Equivalent Command' section that appears in the train_pycaret_models_pagev2.py is not appearing in the deep_learning_page.py, can we add that please?


## Others

enhance anything like metrics?
