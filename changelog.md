## [2024-02-07]

### Added

- Created new `changelog.md` file to track changes in the codebase
- Added requirements.txt file for dependency management
- Added new classes and modules for model training:
  - `UnifiedModelTrainer` for standardized model training interface
  - `IncrementalLearningMixin` and `BatchedRetrainingMixin` for incremental learning support
  - `ModelTrainingMetrics` for tracking and comparing model performance
  - `ModelVersionManager` for model versioning

### Changed

- **run_predictions.py**

  - Improved logging efficiency and reduced console output
  - Increased batch size from 100 to 1000 for better performance
  - Modified progress reporting to show percentage completion instead of individual batch numbers
  - Added progress threshold (10%) to reduce excessive logging
  - Progress messages now show both percentage and batch information
  - For LSTM processing, increased logging interval from 100 to 1000 rows
  - Made error messages more specific and informative
  - Improved readability of progress updates
  - Added batch processing optimization for traditional models
- **model_trainer.py**

  - Enhanced model training with incremental learning support
  - Added MLflow integration for experiment tracking
  - Improved model versioning and history tracking
  - Added support for multi-table training
  - Enhanced error handling and logging
  - Added model metrics tracking and comparison
  - Implemented flexible model parameter handling
- **model_implementations.py**

  - Added XGBoost time series model with incremental learning
  - Enhanced LSTM model implementation
  - Added support for model retraining decisions
  - Improved feature importance tracking
  - Added model-specific parameter validation

### Performance Improvements
